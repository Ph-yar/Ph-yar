<h2>Hello Friends,<h2> 
<p>My name is Ph-yar. I'm a small town gal who grew up on the edge of a cornfield. ðŸŒ± </p>
<p>In my life, I have been fortunate enough to travel past the horizon to meet new people, see new places, and experience what only a handful of people get to experience. 
</p>
<p> For 6 years, I was a family advocate helping people in crisis put their lives back together. Now, I'm a dev student. 
Iâ€™m currently learning: operating systems, support for business applications, network systems and programming. </p>
